# Cipherise
A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. This project allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Features:

Encryption: Encrypt a text message by shifting each letter by shift value.

Decryption: Decrypt an encrypted text message by reversing the shift.

Handles Case Sensitivity: Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Non-Alphabetic Characters: Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are preserved in the encrypted and decrypted text.

## How to Use?

- Encryption:

Enter the text you want to encrypt.

Press enter at the end of your message and after that type 'q' to quit.

Now your message is saved to EncryptedMessage.txt.

- Decryption:

Select the option decrypt.

And now the decrypted message of your encrypted message is saved to DecryptedMessage.txt.

- Clear Messages:

Choose the option clear message to clear both EncryptedMessage.txt and DecryptedMessage.txt.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the Caesar Cipher works:

1. Original Message: HELLO WORLD
2. Shift Value(User input): 5
3. Encrypted Message: MJQQT BTWQI
4. Decrypted Message: HELLO WORLD
